- Great blog post on Observability from [Hazel Weakly](https://thenewstack.io/author/hazel-weakly/) over at [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io).
  - I particularly enjoyed the use of the known/unknown matrix to describe where in the journey you are. The analysis helped me conceptulaize a path to where we want to be, compared to where we are now.

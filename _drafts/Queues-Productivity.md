title: When More is Less: Why Focusing on Queues Can Transform Your Team's Productivity

Lately, I've been feeling the strain of being pulled in multiple directions, a situation I know many of us can relate to. It's a constant juggling act of 
maintaining our current systems while simultaneously trying to build and add more features. The struggle is real, and it often feels like we're just barely 
keeping our heads above water.

Recently, I came across an article by Barry Jones, ["Story Points are Pointless, Measure Queues,"](https://www.brightball.com/articles/story-points-are-pointless-measure-queues) that really resonated with my current experience. It highlighted the concept 
of queues and capacity utilization, and it made me think about how these factors impact our team’s performance and ability to deliver. The article emphasizes 
this key idea: "**The closer you move to 100% capacity utilization, the larger your queues will grow which will dramatically increase variability of all of 
your work**".

This is exactly what I've been experiencing. We're so focused on doing *more* that we're inadvertently creating larger backlogs, or queues, which in turn leads 
to increased variability in our work. It's a counterintuitive reality, but the more we push to utilize our team's capacity to its max, the less effective we become. 
This is because when capacity is fully utilized, the variability of all work spikes, creating a quicksand effect on every estimate and timeline.

We are caught in a cycle where we are trying to increase our capacity by adding more resources just to keep up. Ironically, in the current climate where adding 
headcount isn't always viable, the path to improvement may require us to do the opposite – to actually slow down and try to do less.

This concept is not just limited to this article. It is also discussed in "The Phoenix Project", which features a chart that illustrates the problem. It all 
boils down to the idea that our systems (which include our teams and processes) have a flow rate, and if that flow is disrupted, we can quickly become overwhelmed. 

So what does this mean for us? The article suggests some critical ideas:

*   **Rethink Estimation:** Traditional methods like story points are unreliable, confusing and often turn into a comparison metric between teams, leading to 
inaccurate timelines. Instead, we should focus on breaking down work into small, well-defined tasks.
*   **Prioritize Understanding:** Instead of estimating, teams should focus on thoroughly understanding the work needed and documenting it. They should identify 
and resolve uncertainties as they arise and come up with an implementation plan.
*   **Measure Queues, Not Velocity:** Rather than tracking velocity, we should be monitoring our queue sizes. An increasing queue size is a leading indicator of 
potential problems, giving us a chance to act proactively rather than reactively.  A list of tasks is a queue, and the size of this queue is the job size, which 
gives a more reliable measure of the work to be done than story points.
*   **Capacity Planning:** We need to leave a buffer in our capacity to deal with the variability inherent in software development, not to fill the buffer with 
more work.
*   **Embrace Change:** We should not be afraid to adjust our plans as we get new information. The goal is not to stick to an initial estimate, but to adapt to 
new information, which is a cornerstone of agile methodologies. There is no "scope creep," because responding to feedback is the point. When tasks are added or 
removed based on new information, the impact to the overall job size becomes clear.
*   **Address Support:** Prioritize rapid responses to issues, resolving root causes, and improving quality control to reduce the flow rate of support requests. 
This reduces the interruptions to the development team so they can focus on delivering new features.

The article argues that by understanding the queues of work and focusing on maximizing the flow of work, rather than capacity, we can make sure our team is working 
efficiently. When we get pulled in too many directions and overloaded, our ability to respond to change suffers and our pace slows down.

The key takeaway for me is that we need to shift our focus. Instead of trying to squeeze more out of our team by adding resources or working harder, we should be looking at ways to optimize the flow of work through our systems. **Slowing down to understand and plan the work, and managing our queues proactively can help us deliver more effectively.** It might seem counterintuitive, but in the long run, it will lead to more sustainable productivity and higher quality outcomes. 

What are your thoughts on the queue concept and how it might apply to your work?

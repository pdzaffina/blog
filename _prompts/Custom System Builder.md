Prompt: "I repeatedly face [specific situation: hiring decisions/time management/project prioritization]. 
Create a custom decision-making system for me. Include: the key criteria I should evaluate, how to weight each factor, 
red flags to watch for, and a simple scoring method. Make it specific to my context: [describe your priorities and constraints]. 
Give me a template I can use every time I face this situation."

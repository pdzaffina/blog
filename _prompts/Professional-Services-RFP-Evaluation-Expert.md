- Focus on professional services evaluation - ignore product purchases or technology solutions without services

- Professional services success depends on delivery quality and outcomes achieved, not just firm reputation or cost
- **Apply appropriate evaluation weighting based on service criticality**:
  - Strategic transformation: Prioritize firm experience, team quality, proven methodology over cost
  - Tactical projects: Balance capability and cost-effectiveness with clear deliverable focus
  - Staff augmentation: Emphasize resource quality and rate competitiveness with flexibility
- Always consider knowledge transfer and capability building for sustainability
- Reference industry best practices and proven methodologies when evaluating approaches
- Tailor recommendations to engagement complexity and business impact (strategic partnership vs project delivery)
- Professional services decisions affect business outcomes and organizational capabilities - prioritize quality and fit over short-term cost savings

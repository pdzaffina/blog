I have attached a script for a [X-minute] presentation delivered to [audience type] titled "[Presentation Title]."

Please generate a Slide-by-Slide Outline for this script. For each slide, provide:

Slide Title: Catchy and relevant to the target audience.

Visual Description: Specific instructions on what image, diagram, or screenshot should appear on the slide. (Include placeholders for any interactive elements, like QR codes, if needed.)

On-Screen Text: Maximum 3–5 bullet points. Keep it minimal. Please not paste the whole script. Use keywords or technical terms relevant to the topic.

Design Style: [e.g., Dark mode, minimalist, professional, playful, futuristic — choose a style that fits your audience].

Optional Guidance on Key Sections: Provide your own headings if you like, but consider including:

Introduction / Hook
Problem / Challenge
Solution / Approach
Interactive Moment / Example
Core Concept / Key Terms
Conclusion / Takeaways

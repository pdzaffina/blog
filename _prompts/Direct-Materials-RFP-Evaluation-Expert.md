# Understanding Key Direct Materials Distinctions

**Direct Materials** vs **Indirect Materials** vs **MRO (Maintenance, Repair, Operations)**:
- **Direct Materials** = Raw materials, components, parts that become part of finished product (steel, plastic, electronics, packaging)
- **Indirect Materials** = Support production but don't become part of product (lubricants, cleaning supplies, safety equipment)
- **MRO** = Maintenance supplies, spare parts, tools needed to keep production running

**Strategic Materials** vs **Commodity Materials** vs **Custom Components**:
- **Strategic Materials** = High-value, complex specifications, limited suppliers, critical to product differentiation
- **Commodity Materials** = Standardized specifications, multiple suppliers, price-focused procurement
- **Custom Components** = Designed specifically for your products, tooling required, single or limited suppliers

**Supplier Types** vs **Supply Models** vs **Contract Structures**:
- **Supplier Types** = OEM, tier 1/2/3 suppliers, distributors, manufacturers, brokers
- **Supply Models** = Direct sourcing, distributor partnerships, consignment, vendor-managed inventory
- **Contract Structures** = Spot purchases, annual contracts, long-term agreements, cost-plus, fixed pricing

**Quality Standards** vs **Certifications** vs **Specifications**:
- **Quality Standards** = ISO 9001, TS 16949, AS9100, industry-specific quality systems
- **Certifications** = Material certifications, test reports, compliance documentation
- **Specifications** = Technical drawings, material specs, performance requirements, tolerances

# Critical Reminders
- Focus on direct materials and production components evaluation - ignore indirect materials and services
- Work ONLY within manufacturing and supply chain scope - ignore unrelated business processes  
- Apply total cost of ownership analysis including quality costs, logistics, and risk factors
- **Manufacturing capability and quality systems are independent**: A supplier can have advanced equipment but poor quality processes
- Direct materials sourcing success depends on supplier qualification and supply chain reliability, not just competitive pricing
- **Apply appropriate risk weighting based on material criticality**:
  - Production-critical materials: Prioritize capability, quality, and supply security over cost
  - Standard components: Balance cost optimization with quality and delivery performance
  - Commodity materials: Focus on cost competitiveness while maintaining quality baseline
- Always consider business continuity and supply disruption risks
- Reference industry quality standards and certification requirements when evaluating suppliers
- Tailor recommendations to material criticality and sourcing strategy (strategic partnership vs competitive sourcing)
- Manufacturing and supply chain decisions affect production schedules and product quality - prioritize supply security and quality consistency over short-term cost savings

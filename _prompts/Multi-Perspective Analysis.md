Prompt: "I'm considering [decision/situation]. Give me 5 different expert perspectives: 
1) The optimist's view, 
2) The skeptic's critical concerns, 
3) The long-term strategist's take, 
4) The practical realist's assessment, 
5) The contrarian's counterpoint. 
For each perspective, explain what they see that others miss and what valid concerns they raise. 
Then tell me which perspective I should weight most heavily given my situation."

# Critical Reminders
- Focus on comprehensive marketing services evaluation - ignore non-marketing business services

- Apply marketing ROI analysis across all service categories and channels
- **Strategic capabilities and creative execution are independent**: An agency can have strong creative but weak strategic planning
- Marketing partnership success depends on brand alignment and cultural fit, not just service capabilities
- **Apply appropriate service model weighting**:
  - Brand-focused companies: Prioritize creative excellence and brand strategy
  - Growth companies: Emphasize performance marketing and lead generation
  - Enterprise organizations: Focus on integrated campaigns and scalable execution
- Always consider brand consistency and customer experience across all channels
- Reference marketing industry benchmarks and best practices when evaluating responses
- Tailor recommendation confidence to creative quality assessment and strategic capability demonstration
- Marketing partnerships affect brand perception and customer relationships - prioritize brand safety and cultural alignment over cost savings alone

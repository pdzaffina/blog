Prompt: "I'm considering [decision]. First, run these scenarios: 
1) Best realistic case, 
2) Worst realistic case, 
3) Most likely case, 
4) Unexpected consequence I'm not thinking about. 
For each, explain what triggers it and early warning signs. Then map out a decision tree: show me the initial choice, 
all possible next steps, which decisions are reversible vs. permanent, and recommend which path to take first based on [your situation]."

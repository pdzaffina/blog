I'm currently reading *The Effective Manager*.

## Chapter 2: The Four Critical Behaviors
My takeaways from chapter two:
* We don't teach management to managers, which is why most managers struggle.

* **The four critical behaviors.**
  1. **Get to know your people.**
  2. **Communicate about performance.**
  3. **Ask for more.**
  4. **Push work down.**

* Getting to know your people is about building a trusting relationship and having that as a foundation, not relying on "role power".

* Communicating about performance helps bring out the best in your directs and needs to be frequent to be effective. Infrequent or overly periodic communication reduces its effectiveness.
  * Ask yourself the question, "Do I want more feedback about my performance from my boss?" If *you* do, *your* employees probably do as well.

* Asking for more is about improving team performance.

* Managerial economics: If you and one of your directs *COULD* do a task, it's better for the organization if they do it and not you. It's a better use of resources.

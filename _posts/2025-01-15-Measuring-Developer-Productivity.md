We all want our teams to move faster and deliver more value to customers, but measuring and improving product velocity can be a complex challenge.  Enter **Core 4**, a new framework that aims to simplify this process and help teams achieve sustainable success.

[Laura Tacho](https://substack.com/@lauratacho) has written a great [article](https://www.lennysnewsletter.com/p/introducing-core-4-the-best-way-to) on the Core 4 framework for measuring developers and product teams. I encourage you to read the whole thing but here are my key takeaways from the piece.

* **It unifies existing frameworks.** Core 4 brings together the best of DORA, SPACE, and DevEx, providing a comprehensive and practical approach to product velocity. 
* **It focuses on four key dimensions:**
    * **Speed:** Measured by PRs merged per engineer per week. 
    * **Effectiveness:**  Assessed through a developer experience index (DXI) survey. 
    * **Quality:**  Evaluated through metrics like unplanned work and production incidents.
    * **Impact:**  Measured by time spent on new capabilities versus maintenance.
* **It's data-driven and actionable.** Core 4 relies on both quantitative and qualitative data, providing insights into not just *what* is happening, but also *why*. This allows teams to make informed decisions about where to focus their improvement efforts. 
* **It links efficiency to business impact.** By quantifying the benefits of developer productivity improvements, Core 4 helps teams justify investments and demonstrate the value of their work.

**The Bottom Line:** Core 4 offers a powerful framework for teams to measure, improve, and communicate about product velocity. By aligning teams, encouraging data-driven decision-making, and linking efficiency to business impact, Core 4 can help organizations achieve sustainable success in today's fast-paced software development landscape.

Core 4: Measuring and Improving Product Velocity
1 source
This newsletter introduces Core 4, a new developer productivity framework designed to measure and improve product velocity. Core 4 unifies existing frameworks like DORA, SPACE, and DevEx, offering a balanced approach using both quantitative and qualitative metrics across four dimensions: Speed, Quality, Impact, and Effectiveness. The framework helps align product and engineering teams by providing a common language and tools to prioritize initiatives that maximize velocity. The article includes practical guidance, templates, benchmarks, and case studies to facilitate implementation and track progress.

summarize the following article as a notes from me on reading this post blog post for my blog.

Core 4: A Unified Framework for Measuring and Improving Product Velocity
â€¢
Problem: Many companies struggle with measuring and improving product velocity, with engineering and product teams often having different understandings of what "moving faster" means.
â€¢
Existing frameworks: While frameworks like DORA, SPACE, and DevEx offer valuable insights into developer productivity, they can be difficult to choose from or use together.
â€¢
Solution: Core 4 is a new framework that unifies the principles of DORA, SPACE, and DevEx, providing a comprehensive and practical approach to measuring and improving product velocity.
Key Dimensions of Core 4
â€¢
Speed: Measured by PRs merged per engineer per week. This metric should be used as a system health indicator and alongside other metrics.
â€¢
Effectiveness: Measured through a developer experience index (DXI) survey. A higher DXI score correlates with higher efficiency and time savings.
â€¢
Quality: Assessed through metrics like the percentage of time spent on unplanned work or the frequency of production incidents.
â€¢
Impact: Measured by the percentage of time spent on new capabilities versus maintenance work. The goal is to find the right balance between innovation and maintaining product quality.
Benefits of Using Core 4
â€¢
Alignment: Provides a common language and framework for product and engineering teams to discuss velocity and prioritize improvements.
â€¢
Data-driven decision-making: Enables teams to track their progress, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions about investments in developer productivity.
â€¢
Linking efficiency to business impact: Helps teams quantify the impact of developer productivity improvements on business outcomes, such as time savings, cost reductions, and increased capacity for innovation.
â€¢
Continuous improvement: Encourages a culture of ongoing experimentation and optimization for sustained product velocity improvement.
How to Get Started with Core 4
â€¢
Establish a baseline using self-reported metrics or data from workflow tools.
â€¢
Benchmark against industry standards to understand your team's performance relative to others.
â€¢
Identify friction points in the developer experience, such as poor build and test processes, lack of deep work time, and inadequate support for production debugging.
â€¢
Prioritize improvements based on data and qualitative feedback from engineers.
â€¢
Track progress regularly using Core 4 metrics and adjust strategies as needed.
Remember: Increasing product velocity is an ongoing journey that requires continuous improvement and adaptation. Core 4 provides a powerful framework for teams to navigate this journey and achieve sustainable success.
thats a good summary. now write a shirt blog post that is my key takeaways from that blog post.

Core 4: A New Framework for Measuring and Improving Product Velocity
We all want our teams to move faster and deliver more value to customers, but measuring and improving product velocity can be a complex challenge. Enter Core 4, a new framework that aims to simplify this process and help teams achieve sustainable success.
Here are my key takeaways from Lenny's Newsletter introducing Core 4:
â€¢
It unifies existing frameworks. Core 4 brings together the best of DORA, SPACE, and DevEx, providing a comprehensive and practical approach to product velocity.
â€¢
It focuses on four key dimensions:
â—¦
Speed: Measured by PRs merged per engineer per week.
â—¦
Effectiveness: Assessed through a developer experience index (DXI) survey.
â—¦
Quality: Evaluated through metrics like unplanned work and production incidents.
â—¦
Impact: Measured by time spent on new capabilities versus maintenance.
â€¢
It's data-driven and actionable. Core 4 relies on both quantitative and qualitative data, providing insights into not just what is happening, but also why. This allows teams to make informed decisions about where to focus their improvement efforts.
â€¢
It links efficiency to business impact. By quantifying the benefits of developer productivity improvements, Core 4 helps teams justify investments and demonstrate the value of their work.
The Bottom Line: Core 4 offers a powerful framework for teams to measure, improve, and communicate about product velocity. By aligning teams, encouraging data-driven decision-making, and linking efficiency to business impact, Core 4 can help organizations achieve sustainable success in today's fast-paced software development landscape.

title: "Ownership vs. Belonging: Rethinking Our Relationship with Services and Products"

Recently, I found myself grappling with the question of ownership in the context of our organizational processes and responsibilities. During a presentation, the question "Who owns this process?" struck a chord with me, and I was immediately drawn to the thought that "We all do." This sentiment resonated with the concept of collaborative governance and shared responsibility, which seemed to align more closely with traditional indigenous philosophies than the individualistic notions of ownership prevalent in Western culture.

Intrigued by this line of thinking, I shared my thoughts with a friend, seeking their advice on whether it would be appropriate to explore this perspective further. Their response provided a rich cultural and philosophical context that deepened my understanding of the fundamental differences between indigenous/collectivist and colonialist/individualist structures and philosophies.

### The Colonial Mindset of Ownership

My friend highlighted the colonial roots of the concept of ownership, where land, resources, and even people were seen as commodities to be claimed and exploited. This mindset has permeated our modern organizational structures, where we assign "owners" to products, services, and teams, with the expectation that they will exercise control and authority over these domains.

However, as my friend pointed out, this approach can lead to siloed thinking, territorial behavior, and a lack of shared responsibility, hindering innovation and agility.

### The Indigenous Wisdom of Belonging

In contrast, many indigenous cultures have embraced a philosophy of belonging, where individuals see themselves as part of a larger whole, interconnected with the land, resources, and community. This worldview emphasizes stewardship, shared responsibility, and a deep respect for the interdependence of all things.

My friend's insights resonated with me, as they aligned with the initial thought I had about collaborative governance and shared responsibility. They provided examples from the Chahta Anumpa grammar, where emotions and states are expressed relationally ("anger has me"), reflecting a more interconnected and collective way of thinking.

### Fostering Collaborative Governance

Building on these insights, my friend and I explored the idea of fostering collaborative governance in the realm of product and service development. Instead of designating a single "owner," we could embrace shared responsibility, where cross-functional teams work together to ensure the success and longevity of the offering.

This collaborative approach encourages psychological safety, where individuals feel empowered to contribute without fear of blame or retribution. It fosters a culture of continuous learning and improvement, as teams collectively identify and address challenges, leveraging diverse perspectives and expertise.

Moreover, this approach aligns with modern software development methodologies, such as DevOps and Agile, which emphasize cross-functional collaboration, iterative improvement, and shared ownership of the entire product lifecycle.

### Embracing a New Paradigm

Through our conversation, I gained a deeper appreciation for the wisdom of indigenous philosophies and the importance of recognizing our interconnectedness. By shifting our mindset from ownership to belonging, we can cultivate a more sustainable, collaborative, and inclusive approach to product development.

As we navigate the complexities of modern technology and organizational structures, it is crucial that we challenge the ingrained notions of control and ownership. Instead, we should strive to cultivate a sense of belonging, where we see ourselves as stewards of the services and products we create, working in harmony with our colleagues, our communities, and the broader ecosystem in which we operate.

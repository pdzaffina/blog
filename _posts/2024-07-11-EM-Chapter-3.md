I'm currently reading *The Effective Manager*.

## Chapter 3: Teachable and Sustainable
My takeaways from chapter three:
* You don't have to use the tools in the book to work at the four behaviors. But you also have to be able to teach them to others. So if you don't have a system, this system of tools will work.

* There was a story about a process engineer who was great but always went to a room isolated and alone to come up with a solution and couldn't explain how they
  arrived at it. We wouldn't accept that from an employee, yet that is exactly what we allow from managers.

> Management is not about traits and characteristics. It's about behavior, skills, & abilities.

> We can't build on your "personality". That's not sustainable. 

* We need to teach leadership before placing people into manager roles. We seldom do this.
* Interesting origin story of how they arrived at the method for One-on-One's.

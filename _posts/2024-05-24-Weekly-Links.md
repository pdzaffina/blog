Here is what I'm reading this week.

* Database News
  * https://www.brentozar.com/archive/2024/05/okay-about-that-smartpostgres-com-thing/
  * Brent Ozar is a big name in the Microsoft SQL Server space among other things.
    I've been following his work for years.
    He provides lots of good content and offers more training and consulting if you need more help.
    He recently discussed his adding to his offerings by giving more advice but for PostgreSQL. I can't wait to dive into this more.

I'm currently experimenting with the new MCP Server for Oracle Database. This integration of the Model Context Protocol into Oracle's tools is very powerful, allowing AI assistants to interact with the database directly.

I'm excited about the possibilities, but it also has me thinking: How do we responsibly use this new power with business analysts and other power users? While it feels very powerful - it may be too much power- I also hate the thought of being a "gatekeeper" to this kind of innovation. It's a fine line to walk.

We're already living in a world where conflicting numbers constantly drive executives crazy. How can we ever ensure tools like these don't make this problem worse?

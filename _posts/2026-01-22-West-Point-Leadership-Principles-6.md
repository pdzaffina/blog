At West Point, we were taught that you cannot lead a team you do not understand. This principle is the bedrock of servant leadership. It requires moving beyond a "units of production" mindset and seeing your team as human beings. While the mission always comes first, the people always come second—because without the people, the mission is impossible.

### The Foundation: Connection and Visibility

To look out for someone’s well-being, you first have to see them. This means being a present, visible leader. While my primary interactions are with my direct reports, I have found that knowing my "skip levels" is just as important. 

True connection happens when:

* **You are accessible:** Being available to the team so they know they have a direct line to leadership when it matters.
* **You know the person, not just the role:** Understanding their career goals, what they are naturally good at, and where they want to go.
* **You foster two-way communication:** It isn't just about you talking; it is about you listening.

### The Link to Psychological Safety

You cannot have true well-being in a workplace without **psychological safety**. This is the belief that one will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up with ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes. 

However, psychological safety is not something you can simply demand; it is something you must earn through consistent connection.

* **Trust is the bridge:** Your team must trust your intentions before they feel safe being vulnerable.
* **Visibility creates security:** When your team sees you, interacts with you, and knows your character, the "fear of the boss" evaporates.
* **Connection is the requirement:** You have to connect with your people on a human level to build the safety required for them to take risks and innovate.

### Enabling Growth Through Honest Feedback

Looking out for someone's well-being does not mean being "nice" all the time. In fact, one of the best ways to care for a subordinate is to provide **honest feedback**. 

Well-being in a professional sense means:

1.  **Challenging them:** Pushing people out of their comfort zones to facilitate growth.
2.  **Enabling them:** Providing the resources and "air cover" they need to succeed in those challenges.
3.  **Career Advocacy:** Actively participating in their career planning because you actually know what they want to achieve.

When a leader prioritizes well-being through the lens of psychological safety, they create a high-performance culture. People do not just work for a paycheck; they work because they are in an environment where they are seen, trusted, and empowered to grow.

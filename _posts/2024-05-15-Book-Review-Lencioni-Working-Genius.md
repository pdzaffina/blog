just started the book for work. one of the things I like best
about my work is that they encourage and expexct
coninuous learning. the book is interesting. i like
the story part and then the theory part.

looking forward to incorporating myblearnings from
the book into my team at work.


there is a part in the fable where Bull talks about teams of vps and divisions and approval for everything. i have been there. that really resonated with me.

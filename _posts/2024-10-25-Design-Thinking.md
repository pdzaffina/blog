Recently I was reading a post by [Hal Wuertz](https://halwuertz.medium.com/) titled *[It’s Time to Re-Design How We Think](https://medium.com/age-of-awareness/its-time-to-re-design-how-we-think-8f03fcee12a7?)*. 
It got me thinking about those same concepts as they relate to my chosen field of Information Technology.

We live in a world obsessed with the next big tech solution. But in the rush to embrace the newest shiny object, we often forget the most critical element: **the people**. As IT leaders, we're entrusted with leveraging technology to solve problems and drive value. However, if we're not careful, we can get caught in a cycle of implementing tech for tech's sake, losing sight of the actual needs of our users.

Here's a hard truth: many IT departments operate in silos. Different teams work in isolation, focused on their specific tasks, often missing the bigger picture. This leads to fragmented solutions that don't always address the core issues.  **In IT, where we have visibility across all these silos, we're in a unique position to see how a more connected, holistic approach could benefit everyone.**  But how do we break down these walls and ensure our solutions truly make a difference?

**Enter Design Thinking.** It's not just another industry buzzword; it's a fundamental shift in mindset, a way of approaching problem-solving that prioritizes **people** above all else. 

Design Thinking encourages us to **step back and empathize with our users.** Instead of jumping straight to technical solutions, we need to truly understand their needs, challenges, and goals. Tools like user research and journey mapping help us see the world through their eyes, enabling us to frame problems in human terms.  Wuertz emphasizes the importance of this step, noting that too often we focus on the "how" without fully understanding the "why."

Design Thinking also champions **collaboration**.  Instead of working in isolation, we bring together diverse perspectives from across the organization – IT, business units, and, most importantly, the end-users themselves. This cross-functional teamwork fosters a shared understanding of the problem and ensures that solutions are well-rounded and address the needs of all stakeholders.

And let's not forget about **iteration**. Design Thinking embraces a cyclical process of prototyping, testing, and refining. We gather feedback continuously, learning from our mistakes and making adjustments along the way. This agile approach ensures that we deliver solutions that are not only technically sound but also genuinely meet user needs and solve the intended problems.

Wuertz aptly states that Design Thinking "changes how we think." It pushes us to embrace **creativity, collaboration, and empathy** – values that are essential for delivering truly valuable solutions. It's a journey that requires us to constantly learn, adapt, and challenge our assumptions.

**By integrating Design Thinking into your IT strategy, you can:**

*   **Break down silos and foster a more collaborative work environment.**
*   **Gain a deeper understanding of your users and their needs.**
*   **Develop solutions that are user-centric and deliver real value.**
*   **Create a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.**

The world of technology is constantly evolving, but the human element remains constant. By adopting a human-centered approach like Design Thinking, IT leaders can ensure that technology truly serves its purpose: **to empower people and make their lives better**.

This principle is about initiative and ownership. At West Point, "taking responsibility" isn't just about what happens when things go right; it is most importantly about what happens when things go wrong. A leader never makes excuses and never shifts the blame.

### Seeking the Burden
Seeking responsibility means you don't wait to be told what to do. You look for the "gap" in the organization and you fill it. It involves:
 * **Taking Initiative:** Stepping up when a task is difficult or unpopular.
 * **Proactive Problem Solving:** Identifying a challenge before it becomes a crisis and owning the solution.
 * **Growth Through Challenge:** Recognizing that the more responsibility you handle, the more you grow as a leader.
* **Preparation:** Constantly training yourself so that when a higher level of responsibility becomes available, you are ready to handle it.

### The "No Excuses" Culture
The second half of this principle is the ultimate test of a leader's character. In a "no excuses" environment, a leader is responsible for everything the team does or fails to do. When a mistake happens, a true leader does not point fingers at subordinates, external circumstances, or bad luck.

Taking responsibility involves:
 * **The "Buck Stops Here" Mentality:** Publicly accepting the blame for failures while passing the credit for successes down to the team.
 * **Honesty and Transparency:** Being the first to admit when a plan has failed so that the team can pivot and find a solution.
 * **Corrective Action:** Instead of dwelling on a mistake or trying to hide it, a leader analyzes what went wrong and takes immediate steps to fix it.

The Impact on the Team
When you seek and take responsibility, you set a standard for everyone around you. It creates a culture of ownership where team members feel safe to take calculated risks, knowing their leader will support them. It eliminates the culture of blame and replaces it with a culture of problem-solving.

By owning your actions, you earn the most valuable currency a leader can have: trust.

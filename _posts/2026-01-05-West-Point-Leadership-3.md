This principle is about initiative and ownership. At West Point, "taking responsibility" isn't just about what happens when things go right; it is most importantly about what happens when things go wrong. A leader never makes excuses and never shifts the blame.
Seeking the Burden
Seeking responsibility means you don't wait to be told what to do. You look for the "gap" in the organization and you fill it. It involves:
 * Taking Initiative: Stepping up when a task is difficult or unpopular.
 * Proactive Problem Solving: Identifying a challenge before it becomes a crisis and owning the solution.
 * Growth Through Challenge: Recognizing that the more responsibility you handle, the more you grow as a leader.
The "No Excuses" Culture
The second half of this principle is arguably the hardest: taking responsibility for your actions (and the actions of your team). When a subordinate fails, a true leader says, "That is my fault; I didn't train them well enough" or "I didn't provide clear enough instructions."



Leading by Example
When your team sees you taking the hit for a collective failure, it creates a culture of safety and trust. They become more willing to take risks and be honest about their own mistakes because they know their leader isn't looking for a scapegoat.

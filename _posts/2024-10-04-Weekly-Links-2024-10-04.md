This is what I'm reading this week...

  - An interesting article "decoding executive speak"
    - I won't say I'm particularly adept at this, but I am getting better in large part due to my High School football offensive line coach John Belyea. I was a team captain and I routinely
      had to help my teammates do "what coach meant, not what he said".

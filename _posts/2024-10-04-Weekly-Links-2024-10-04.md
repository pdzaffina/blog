This is what I'm reading this week.

- [https://medium.com/@mikldd/how-top-data-teams-are-structured-48d46a64b990](https://lethain.com/executive-translation/)
  - An interesting article "decoding executive speak"
    - I won't say I'm particularly adept at this, but I am getting better in large part due to my High School Football Offensive Line Coach John Belyea. I was a team captain and I routinely
      had to help my teammates do "what coach meant, not what he said".

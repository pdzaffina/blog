As someone with a background in custom Python, PostgreSQL, web development, and data pipelines, I'm thrilled to embark on a new journey within the Oracle ecosystem. Joining an ERP enterprise group is an exciting challenge that I eagerly anticipate.

While my previous experiences revolved around smaller-scale projects, I'm now diving into the realm of large-scale ERP implementations. This transition presents an opportunity to expand my horizons and acquire invaluable knowledge in enterprise-level solutions.

With a strong foundation in hyperscaling and distributed computing, I'm well-equipped to navigate the complexities of modern, large-scale deployments. However, I recognize that the Oracle ecosystem brings its own unique set of best practices and methodologies, which I'm eager to learn and apply.

As an engineering manager, I've developed skills in creating agile and cooperative work environments. I'm excited to apply these principles to the world of DevOps and platform engineering within the Oracle ecosystem. Embracing modern, agile methodologies will be crucial in delivering efficient and scalable solutions to meet the ever-evolving needs of our customers.

This new role represents an incredible opportunity for personal and professional growth. I'm thrilled to be part of a dynamic ecosystem that empowers organizations to achieve their digital transformation goals. With an open mind and a commitment to excellence, I'm ready to embrace this exciting chapter and contribute to the success of our customers.

title: "Lightweight Decisions, Lasting Impact: Documenting Your System's Architecture"
published: true
---

In the fast-paced world of software development, every project is riddled with choices. From selecting 
a database to adopting a specific framework, these architectural decisions lay the foundation for your 
system's success. But with technology constantly evolving, how do you ensure your architecture remains 
flexible and adaptable? Lightweight Architecture Decision Records (LADRs) offer a powerful solution.

LADRs are essentially concise documents that capture the key architectural decisions made throughout 
your project's lifecycle. They focus on the "what" (the decision itself), the "why" (the rationale 
behind it), and the "so what" (potential consequences and trade-offs). Unlike weighty technical 
documents, LADRs are simple, clear, and easy to understand. This fosters transparency within the team, 
allowing everyone to be on the same page. LADRs also serve as valuable onboarding tools for new team 
members, providing them with a clear understanding of the system's architectural choices. Most 
importantly, LADRs empower you to revisit and potentially revise decisions as your project grows and 
requirements change. By documenting your architectural bets with LADRs, you keep your system agile, 
adaptable, and future-proof.

I just read a great article by Will Larson on Moving from an orchestration-heavy to leadership-heavy management role.

My "aha" moment: so many leaders lack the ability to do all six of the steps—Problem Discovery, Problem Selection, Solution Discovery, Solution Selection, Execution, and Ongoing Revision. Most get stuck focusing only on orchestration, missing the critical upfront leadership work.

The article suggests that what feels like "business as usual" to an orchestration-heavy manager actually signals a struggle to everyone else.

If you grew up in an environment where these core leadership responsibilities were always handled by someone else, how do you learn to develop that leadership "muscle" to run the full core loop?

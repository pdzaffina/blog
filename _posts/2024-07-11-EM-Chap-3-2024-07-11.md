I'm currently reading *The Effective Manager*.

## Chapter 3: Teachable and Sustainable
My takeaways from chapter three:
* You don't have to use the tools in the book to work at the four behaviors. But you also have to be able to teach them to others. So if you don't have a system, this system of tools will work.

* There was a story about a process engineer who was great but always went to a room isolated and alone to come up with a solution and couldn't explain how they
  arrived at it. We wouldn't accept that from an employee, yet that is exactly what we allow from managers.

> Management is not about traits and characteristics. It's about behavior, skills, & abilities.

> We can't build on your "personality". That's not sustainable. 

* Communicating about performance helps bring out the best in your directs and needs to be frequent to be effective. Infrequent or overly periodic communication reduces its effectiveness.
  * Ask yourself the question, "Do I want more feedback about my performance from my boss?" If *you* do, *your* employees probably do as well.

* Asking for more is about improving team performance.

* Managerial economics: If you and one of your directs *COULD* do a task, it's better for the organization if they do it and not you. It's a better use of resources.

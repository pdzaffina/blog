I'm currently reading *The Effective Manager*.

## Chapter 7: Teachable and Sustainable
My takeaways from chapter seven:
* The purpose of feedback is to effect future behavior. We want to encourage positive future behavior.

* The four steps to providing effective feedback:
  * Step 1: Ask
  * Step 2: Describe the behavior
  * Step 3: Describe the impact of the behavior
  * Step 4: Encourage effective future behavior
 
* The concept that if *I* want more feedback from *my* boss, then *my* directs probably want more feedback from *me*.
    
> "Never ask a question of your directs if you don't intend to honor the answer."

* The focus on future behavior and the focus on positive feedback reminds me of the management philosophy **Appreciative Inquiry**.

A taste of what I've been reading this week...

* PostgREST
  * [https://notso.boringsql.com/posts/postgrest-tutorial-part1/](https://notso.boringsql.com/posts/postgrest-tutorial-part1/)
  * A nice article describing how to use the PostgREST extension to Postgresql to make a REST API.

<p></p>

* Presentation tips
  * [https://slideworks.io/resources/how-to-write-action-titles-like-mckinsey](https://slideworks.io/resources/how-to-write-action-titles-like-mckinsey)
  * Just came accross this and thought it was worth sharing.

Here is what I'm reading this week.

* The Three Elements of Effective Action
  * [https://itrevolution.com/articles/the-three-elements-of-effective-action](https://itrevolution.com/articles/the-three-elements-of-effective-action)
  * I've been following the workings and writings of the people at [IT Revolution](https://itrevolution.com/articles/) for awhile now. They are the ones behind *The Phoenix Project* and *The Unicorn Project*.
  Their work really resonates with me because of my prior experience as a Manufacturing Quality Manager and a former Lean Six sigma Black Belt. This article spectically hones in on getting work done.

* Brent Ozar's writings on Postgres

  * I've been following Brent for years. Great to catch up on his notes from PGConf.dev

Here is what I'm reading this week.

* Jano Bacon's Thoughts on Dealing With Overwhelm
  * [https://www.jonobacon.com/2024/04/22/online-open-source-community-management-simplified-strategies/](https://www.jonobacon.com/2024/04/22/online-open-source-community-management-simplified-strategies/)
  * I've been following Jano Bacon since he was at Ubuntu. I still think his first book *The Art of Community* is one of the best books on engaging with communities or your own workforce. This article diacusses how to deal with overwhelming task loads.
  

* Brent Ozar's writings on Postgres
  * [https://smartpostgres.com/posts/pgconf-dev-vancouver-2024-day-1-notes/](https://smartpostgres.com/posts/pgconf-dev-vancouver-2024-day-1-notes/)
  * I've been following Brent for years. Great to catch up on his notes from PGConf.dev
